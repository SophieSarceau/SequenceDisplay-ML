## Sequence Display-Enabled Machine Learning for Protein Evolution
Sequence Display is an innovative platform that enables, for the first time, the generation of **large-scale protein sequence–activity datasets**. By integrating these comprehensive sequence–activity datasets with **pre-trained protein language models (pLMs)**, the platform reconstructs fine-grained, **variant-specific activity landscapes**, facilitating the discovery of **high-performance protein variants**.

To implement this innovative platform, we incorporated a recording barcode adjacent to the POI library sequence. A base editing system was designed to selectively target the barcode, with POI activity influencing the mutation frequency introduced by the base editor. This allows base changes to serve as a quantitative measure of activity levels across different protein variants. Following mutagenesis, next-generation sequencing (NGS) captures both the variant sequences and their corresponding mutated barcodes, generating a comprehensive sequence-activity dataset for the POI. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for training pLMs to map sequence-activity relationships. We successfully applied this platform to evolve **_Staphylococcus lugdunensis_ Cas9 (SlugCas9)** for expanded PAM recognition

pLMs, including ESM-2 and SaProt, are used to extract local embeddings based on cosine similarity calculations for each amino acid in the SlugCas9 sequence. The last 150 residues are selected based on similarity differences and mean pooling is applied to generate a compressed representation. This representation serves as input for an MLP decoder, which predicts the activity levels of SlugCas9 variants across four PAMs—NNGA, NNGT, NNGC, and NNGG.
