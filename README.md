Sequence Display is an innovative platform that enables, for the first time, the generation of **large-scale protein sequence–activity datasets**. By integrating these comprehensive sequence–activity datasets with **pre-trained pLMs**, the platform reconstructs fine-grained, **variant-specific activity landscapes**, facilitating the discovery of **high-performance protein variants**. We successfully applied this platform to evolve **_Staphylococcus lugdunensis_ Cas9 (SlugCas9)** for expanded PAM recognition.
